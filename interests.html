  <p>I am looking to broaden my experience in Ruby, Postgres, and Javascript front end development (Vue &amp; Vuex, React &amp; Redux et al.). I bring a sound working knowledge of container-based devops, working with Docker and Amazon AWS in the past, but also having an eye on Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform.</p>

  <p>I prefer to adhere to a Test Driven Design workflow. The peace of mind that a thorough &amp; incisive test harness brings to a team is indispensible to delivering an agile, feature complete &amp; correct solution to stakeholders.</p>

  <p>I have worked with various Google API’s (Google places, Google drive, Permissions API), and am comfortable working with JSON based API’s, aware of the challenges and tradeoffs this brings.</p>

  <p>I have a working knowledge of spatial functionality provided by PostGIS. If your application requires spatial functionality (distance finding, mapping, path finding), I have worked with PostGIS and Google to these ends.</p>

  <p>My natural environment is within a pry/byebug session, debugging the internals of a Rails application, or whichever gem currently seems to be misbehaving.</p>

  <p>I have a deep understanding of Javascript, prototypes, dynamic scoping, ES6, build time tools (webpacker, rollup) and everything else required to get front-end working, and keep it that way.</p>

  <p>I am also interested in Flutter, which looks to be a promising technology for targeting heterogenous smartphone environments within one technology stack.</p>

  <h2 id="current-interests">Current Interests</h2>

  <p>I generally keep an eye on where current trends are going, and which technologies are relevant and applicable to industry needs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Flutter apps. Google’s mobile stack appears to attack the problem of multiple platforms, from the right levels. The language, and a runtime that does away with differing widget heirarchies. Only a company with the resources comparable to google could attempt, and pull this off.</li>
    <li>eBPF, the virtual machine within the Linux Kernel. This is an interesting development, enabling observability superpowers within Linux.</li>
    <li>Docker, manage deployment environments within your repository. Very nice tool, but it appears to be ceding to:</li>
    <li>Kubernetes, This is on my todo list.</li>
  </ul>
