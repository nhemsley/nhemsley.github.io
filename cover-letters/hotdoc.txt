To whom it may concern.

This email is in regards
I am looking to broaden my experience in Ruby, Postgres, and Javascript front end development (Vue & Vuex, React & Redux et al.). I bring a sound working knowledge of container-based devops, working with Docker and Amazon AWS in the past, but also having an eye on Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform.

I prefer to adhere to a Test Driven Design workflow. The peace of mind that a thorough & incisive test harness brings to a team is indispensible to delivering an agile, feature complete & correct solution to stakeholders.

I have worked with various Google API’s (Google places, Google drive, Permissions API), and am comfortable working with JSON based API’s, aware of the challenges and tradeoffs this brings.

I have a working knowledge of spatial functionality provided by PostGIS. If your application requires spatial functionality (distance finding, mapping, path finding), I have worked with PostGIS and Google to these ends.

My natural environment is within a pry/byebug session, debugging the internals of a Rails application, or whichever gem currently seems to be misbehaving.

I have a deep understanding of Javascript, prototypes, dynamic scoping, ES6, build time tools (webpacker, rollup) and everything else required to get front-end working, and keep it that way.

I am also interested in Flutter, which looks to be a promising technology for targeting heterogenous smartphone environments within one technology stack.
