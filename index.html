<p><a href="./projects/salvatore.html">Fluid Simulation of Breaking waves</a>, with contoured bathymetry. This was my first foray into the Rust programming language.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rezural/mesh-ripper">Mesh Ripper</a>. This was an offshoot of my experiments with <a href="./projects/salvatore.html">Salvatore</a> fluid simulation. Paraview, while servicable had an awkward UI, and was not quite real-time enough for me. I had a mesh viewer running within a week. This really showed the performance and stability of the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy Game Engine</a>, and Rust. It also proved to me the superiority of Rust, for relatively complicated applications, both from ease of use of the language, and application development time. While rust is immature for 3d programming, 3d formats, and advanced use cases, the speed of application development, and especially package management sold me on this language in the long term, and for <em>appropriate</em> projects.</p>
